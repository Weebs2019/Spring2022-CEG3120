## Objectives

- Containerize an application with Docker
- Automate the project pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Explore usage of webhooks to keep production up to date

## Project Overview

For this project you will be creating a fresh repository - the link is in Pilot under Content - Projects - Project 5. This is the repo you will be using for this project.

You will notice that each part has "Milestone" labels and dates. This project is not due until 4/22. Completion of each milestone **by the date specificied for the milestone** will get you 1 pt of extra credit per milestone date met. To qualify, you must submit your project to the Dropbox for Project 5 in Pilot.

## Part 1 - Dockerize it

- **Milestone Participation due 3/30**

### Tasks

- Create new GitHub repo (link to create located in Pilot in Content -> Project 5)
- In a folder named `website`, add the contents of your website
  - this can be a site you created in another class, pet project of yours, or just a vanilla html file
- Install Docker
  - You can install Docker in WSL2 or in an EC2 instance. You'll need your Project 5 repo on wherever you are working
- Create a container image that will run a webserver and contains your "website"
  - you can use apache2 or nginx as the webserver
- Create a Dockerfile with instructions on how to build the image
- Add site content & Dockerfile to repo

### Documentation

- Create `README.md` in main folder of your repo that details the following:
- Project Overview
- Run Project Locally
  - how you installed docker + dependencies (WSL2, for example)
  - how to build the container
  - how to run the container
  - how to view the project (open a browser...go to ip and port...)

## Part 2 - GitHub Actions and DockerHub

- **Milestone Participation due 4/8**

### Tasks

- Create DockerHub account: https://hub.docker.com/ (select Free tier if prompted)
- Create Public Repository in DockerHub
- Set GitHub Secrets named DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD with your respective information filled out.
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow to build and push docker image to DockerHub
  - Use workflow templated here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-docker-hub

### Documentation

- Update `README.md` in main folder of your repo to include:

- Create DockerHub public repo
  - process to create
- Allow DockerHub authentication via CLI using Dockhub credentials
- Configure GitHub Secrets
  - what credentials are needed - DockerHub credentials (do not state your credentials)
  - set secrets and secret names
- Configure GitHub Workflow
  - variables to change (repository, etc.)

### Resources

- [GitHub Actions - Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/ci-cd/github-actions/)

## Part 3 - Deployment

- **Milestone Participation due 4/20**

### Tasks

- For this piece, use an EC2 instance.
- Install docker on the instance
- Create a webhook set up to automatically deploy updates to the container image

### Documentation

- Update `README.md` in main folder of your repo to include:
- Creating a webhook

### Resources

- [using github actions and webhooks](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/automated-deployment-using-docker-github-actions-and-webhooks-54018fc12e32)
- [Link needed - webhooks with DockerHub]

## Submission

1. Commit and push your changes to your repository. Verify that these changes show in your course  
   repository.

   - Your repo should contain:
   - `README.md`
   - `website` folder with website pages
   - `Dockerfile`
   - GitHub action yml file

2. In Pilot, paste the link to your project folder.
